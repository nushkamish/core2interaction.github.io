             Also known as a Mumbai Sandwich is an Indian Sandwich that 
            is popular in the streets of Mumbai.This famous Indian Street Food 
            is made with green chutney, butter, potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers,
            onions, grated cheese, and chaat masala. On occasion, 
            I've also seen the addition of beets and green bell peppers
            on these sandwiches.

            For this famous vegetable sandwich, the vegetables are thinly sliced 
            and spiced with chat masala. You can enjoy this sandwich grilled or not, 
            it tastes great either way.
            <br> 
            The combination of all the veggies, cheese, chutney, and butter is delectable.

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Bread: </strong> If you prefer a grilled sandwich, 
                            then use sourdough bread. If you prefer a 
                            sandwich that's not grilled, then use soft white bread.</li>
                        <li><strong>Veggies: </strong>Tomato, Onions, Cucumber, Potatoes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> Any cheese that melts well will work in this recipe. 
                            I used white Mexican cheese, you can use Mexican cheese blend, 
                            Cheddar Cheese, Pepper Jack Cheese, or even Amul Cheese. 
                            It's best to use grated cheese.  
                        <li><strong>Chat Masala: </strong>You need chat masala or sandwich masala in this recipe. Both work.</li>
                        <li><strong>Butter: </strong> Butter makes this sandwich so delicious, I prefer using unsalted butter for this recipe.
                             Definitely don't skimp.
        
                        <li><strong>Cilantro Chutney: </strong>A must-have. <a href="https://www.honeywhatscooking.com/cilantro-chutney/">Here's my recipe for Cilantro Chutney. </a>
                            Alternatively, you can use Mint Chutney or a combo of both. This is what makes the sandwich desi, in addition, to chat masala.
